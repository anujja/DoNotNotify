DoNotNotify lets you filter and block unwanted notifications using customizable rules.

<b>Features:</b>

• <b>Notification Blocking</b> - Block notifications in real-time
• <b>Flexible Rules</b> - Create denylist (block matching) or allowlist (allow only matching) rules
• <b>Pattern Matching</b> - Match notification title/text using simple contains or regex patterns
• <b>Time-Based Rules</b> - Schedule rules to activate only during specific time windows
• <b>Prebuilt Rules</b> - 40+ pre-configured rules for popular apps (e-commerce promos, social media, etc.)
• <b>Auto-Install Rules</b> - Automatically adds relevant prebuilt rules when you install supported apps
• <b>Notification History</b> - View all received notifications with configurable retention
• <b>Blocked History</b> - Track which notifications were blocked and by which rules
• <b>Import/Export</b> - Backup and restore your rules as JSON files
• <b>Fully Offline</b> - No network permissions, no data collection

<b>How It Works:</b>

1. Grant notification listener permission when prompted
2. View incoming notifications in the History tab
3. Long-press a notification to create a blocking rule, or browse prebuilt rules
4. Blocked notifications appear in the Blocked tab
5. Tap any blocked notification to view details or edit the rule that blocked it

This app requires notification listener permission to function. It does not collect or transmit any data.
